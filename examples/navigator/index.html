      <h2>Navigator</h2>
      <p>
        Interface for the state and identity of the user agent or what browser
        is being used. This is available on the global object
        <code>window</code> or just simply <code>navigator</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>User Agent</h2>
      <p>
        The application that remotely accesses a different computer or server
        over the network. ie - The browser that is running or loading the
        website
      </p>
      <p>
        Your computer (the client) is connecting to a website (the server) via
        the User Agent. This is accessed via navigator.userAgent and includes
        application name and version, host operating system
      </p>

      <h2>Why does Chrome, Edge, and Others say Mozilla</h2>
      <p>
        Mozilla released as Netscape, codename of Mozilla as Mosaic Killer. IE
        Released and started User-Agent with Mozilla in order to use Frames
        feature that was not supported by other browsers but supported by IE and
        Netscape. Chrome and others started with Mozilla like the previous
        browsers had before and now say Mozilla, Chrome, Safari making
        user-agent testing problematic.
